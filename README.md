# breast_cancer_data
Detecting whether cancerous cells found in breast cancer are classified as malignant or benign

Applying Support vector machine to the in-built dataset from sklearn along with the help of GridSearch. 

Getting the right parameters (C, gamma values), combinations are entered to see what works best. 
Thus, a grid of parameters is created and all the possible combinations are tried out.



  C parameter: controls cost of misclassification on training data, large c value gives low value and high variance, smaller c values: vice versa

  Gamma  parameter: Free parameter in radio basis function, large gamma, high bias, low variance: not a widespread influence.
